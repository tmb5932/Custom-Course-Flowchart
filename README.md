### Authors Note
I had the idea for this web application from the pdf course flowcharts given by RIT. 
The problem was that I transfered in certain courses, which meant that I couldn't follow the given flowchart exactly. This led to me having to simply not use it when it when I went to plan my courses, saving a text file that I needed to retype every time I decided on a different plan. This is my solution to my problem.
